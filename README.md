# Algorithm Tests
This repository suppose to be a place to test out algorithm implementations


## Algorithms included

### Quick sort
The C++ implementation of quick sort algorithm

#### Pros
* use the orginal buffer
* no copy of buffers
* parameter controlled ascending or descending
* structure to support different sorting algorithm by adding classes

#### Cons
* currently test data is included in the code
* should create command line interfaces for testing data
* using c++11 feature (initializer lists)


## Building
Under command line, type 
`make`
to make binarys, make sure gcc or clang is installed, this will require c++11 feature to be enabled.
